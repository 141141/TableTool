A simple CSV editor for OS X.

The CSV format is a common used file format to store and exchange tabular data. 
Almost all spreadsheet and database apps (e.g. Excel and Numbers) support it.
Unfortunately, not all CSV files are made equal.
There are differences either in record delimiter, character encoding, decimal separator or quote style.
These differences can lead to serious errors. 

TableTool handles these issues automatically.
It detects the specification of a CSV file for you and displays its contents in a table view.
Using TableTool is the easy way to create, edit and convert CSV files.

Download the most recent build in the [releases section](https://github.com/jakob/TableTool/releases).

## Usage

You can also set the specifications manually.

Edit the contents of the cells, rows and columns of the document easily in a grid based user interface.

### Convert:
Convert an existing file to a different format.
