# TableTool
A simple CSV editor for the Mac

This program was created as a summer project by @aigi, who worked as an intern in my company.

Unfortunately, I don't really have time to work on this app, so no-one is actively developing it at the moment.

You can download the most recent build in the [releases section](https://github.com/jakob/TableTool/releases).

If you are interested in building apps like this, and would like to work in Linz, Austria, drop me a line:
